# A Book Searching Website based on MongoDB
 A project aims at learning the related knowledge about Bigdata and Web Construction

This is a book search website using the vue3 framework, using MongoDB to build the database. The data set comes from the open source data Kindle Book List, which contains 130,000 Kindle e-books (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/amazon-kindle-books-dataset-2023-130k-books/data).

This website allows you to use some useful methods in the database to collect books, view details, cut data, jump pages, and get different sorting method results. The Presentation.mp4 file shows the basic functions and page deployment results.

Detailed methods, code introductions, and deployment methods can be found in the A detailed introduction to this project.pdf file.
